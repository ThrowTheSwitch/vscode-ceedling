## ⚠️ Changed

The 1.0.0 release of this VS Code extension is a fork of the orphaned _Ceedling Test Explorer_ extension [[Github][ceedling-test-explorer-github], [Marketplace][ceedling-test-explorer-marketplace]] originally authored by [Kin Numaru](https://github.com/numaru).

Ceedling 1.0.0 compatibility has been added to the original extension project by merging a [PR][1.0.0-pr] authored by [@simeon-s1](https://github.com/simeon-s1).
