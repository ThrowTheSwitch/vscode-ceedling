# Features

* Displays a Test Explorer in the Test view of VS Code‚Äôs sidebar with all detected tests and suites with their state.
* Adds CodeLenses to your test files for starting and debugging tests.
* Adds Gutter decorations to your test files showing the tests‚Äô state.
* Adds line decorations to the source line where a test failed.
* Shows a failed test‚Äôs log when the test is selected in the explorer.
* Lets you choose test suites that should be run automatically after each file change.
* Can be configured to report compiler and linker problems inline in the editor and in the Problems panel.

# Getting started

* Install the extension and restart VS Code.
* Open the workspace or folder containing your Ceedling 1.0.0+ project.
* Configure your Ceedling project configuration filepath in VS Code‚Äôs settings if required [see below](#options).
* Configure the shell path where Ceedling is installed in the VS Code‚Äôs settings if required (Windows) [see below](#options)
* [Enable and configure][cppunit-plugin] the `report_tests_log_factory` Ceedling plugin with the `cppunit` option in your Ceedling project configuration. This generates an XML test report on which this extension depends.
* Open the Test view.
* Run your tests using the ![Run](img/run.png) icons in the Test Explorer or the CodeLenses in your test file.

# Configuration

## Options

Property                                | Description
----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`ceedlingExplorer.projects`             | An array of objects with the path to the Ceedling project (or yml-file) to use (relative to the workspace folder):<br> - "path": can point either to a directory containing a "project.yml" file or directly to another .yml file(with the respective project.yml in the same directory). This path should be relative to the workspace root directory.<br> - "debugLaunchConfig": must be the *name* property of the launch config (launch.json) that is used for this project. The ${command:ceedlingExplorer.debugTestExecutable} must still be used.<br> - "name" (optional): used as name for the folder containing the tests in the test explorer
`ceedlingExplorer.shellPath`            | The path to the shell where Ceedling is installed. By default (or if this option is set to `null`) it use the OS default shell.
`ceedlingExplorer.debugConfiguration`   | The Debug configuration to run during debugging. See Debugging for more info.  
`ceedlingExplorer.prettyTestLabel`      | The test label is prettier in the test explorer, that mean the label is shorter and without begin prefix. E.g. inactive `test_BlinkTaskShouldToggleLed`, active `BlinkTaskShouldToggleLed` <br> Inactive: <br> ![prettyTestLabelInactive](img/prettyTestLabelInactive.png) <br> Active: <br> ![prettyTestLabelActive](img/prettyTestLabelActive.png)
`ceedlingExplorer.prettyTestFileLabel`  | The test file label is prettier in the test explorer, that mean the label is shorter, without begin prefix, path and file type. E.g. inactive `test/LEDs/test_BlinkTask.c`, active `BlinkTask` <br> Inactive: <br> ![prettyTestFileLabelInactive](img/prettyTestFileLabelInactive.png) <br> Active: <br> ![prettyTestFileLabelActive](img/prettyTestFileLabelActive.png)
`ceedlingExplorer.testCommandArgs`      | The command line arguments used to run Ceedling tests. The first argument have to litteraly contain the `${TEST_ID}` tag. The value `["test:${TEST_ID}"]` is used by default. For example, the arguments `"test:${TEST_ID}", "gcov:${TEST_ID}", "utils:gcov"` can be used to run tests and generate a gcov report.
`ceedlingExplorer.problemMatching`      | Configuration of compiler/linker problem matching. See [Problem matching](#problem%20matching) section for details.
`ceedlingExplorer.testCaseMacroAliases` | An array of aliases for the `TEST_CASE` macro. By default it is `["TEST_CASE"]`
`ceedlingExplorer.testRangeMacroAliases`| An array of aliases for the `TEST_RANGE` macro. By default it is `["TEST_RANGE"]`
`ceedlingExplorer.ansiEscapeSequencesRemoved`| Should the ansi escape sequences be removed from ceedling stdout and stderr. By default it is `true`
<br>

## Problem matching

Problem matching is the mechanism that scans Ceedling output text for known error/warning/info strings and reports these inline in the editor and in the Problems panel. Tries to resemble VSCode Tasks problemMatchers mechanism.

![problems](img/problems.png)

Problem matching configuration options:
Property           | Description
-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`mode`             | Mode of problem matching. It is either "disabled", uses preset (i.e. "gcc") or uses custom "patterns" from patterns array. Default is "disabled".
`patterns`         | Array of custom pattern objects used for problem matching. If mode is set to "patterns", Ceedling output is scanned line by line using each pattern provided in this array. Default is empty array.
<br>

Example configuration which is sufficient in most cases:
```json
"ceedlingExplorer.problemMatching": {
	"mode": "gcc"
}
```

Problem matching pattern options:
Property&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Description
-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`scanStdout`       | Scan stdout output for problems. Default is false.
`scanStderr`       | Scan stderr output for problems. Default is true.
`severity`         | Severity of messages found by this pattern. Correct values are "error", "warning" and "info". Default is "info".
`filePrefix`       | Used to determine file‚Äôs absolute path if file location is relative. ${projectPath} replaced with project path. Empty string means that file location in message is absolute. Default is empty string.
`regexp`           | The regular expression which is used to find an error, warning or info in the output line. ECMAScript (JavaScript) flavor, with global flag. Tip: you may find [regex101](https://regex101.com/) useful while experimenting with patterns. This property is required.
`message`          | Index of the problem‚Äôs message in the regular expression. This property is required.
`file`             | Index of the problem‚Äôs filename in the regular expression. This property is required.
`line`             | Index of the problem‚Äôs (first) line in the regular expression. Not used if null or not defined.
`lastLine`         | Index of the problem‚Äôs last line in the regular expression. Not used if null or not defined."
`column`           | Index of the problem‚Äôs (first) column in the regular expression. Not used if null or not defined.
`lastColumn`       | Index of the problem‚Äôs last column in the regular expression. Not used if null or not defined.
<br>

Example pattern object (GCC compiler warnings):
```json
{
    "severity": "warning",
    "filePrefix": "${projectPath}",
    "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):(\\d+):\\s+warning:\\s+(.*)$",
    "message": 4,
    "file": 1,
    "line": 2,
    "column": 3
}
```

# Commands

The following commands are available in VS Code‚Äôs command palette, use the ID to add them to your keyboard shortcuts:

ID                                 | Command
-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------
`ceedlingExplorer.clean`           | Run `ceedling clean`
`ceedlingExplorer.clobber`         | Run `ceedling clobber`
`test-explorer.reload`             | Reload tests
`test-explorer.run-all`            | Run all tests
`test-explorer.run-file`           | Run tests in current file
`test-explorer.run-test-at-cursor` | Run the test at the current cursor position
`test-explorer.cancel`             | Cancel running tests

# Debugging

To set up debugging, create a new Debug Configuration. `${command:ceedlingExplorer.debugTestExecutable}` 
can be used access the .out test executable filename being ran. Depending on your Ceedling configuration these can be found in `projectPath/build/test/out/`.
Then, edit the `ceedlingExplorer.debugConfiguration` settings with the name of the Debug Configuration to run during debug.

Note: Individual test debugging is not supported. Instead the entire test file will be ran, so skip or remove breakpoints accordingly.

Example configuration with Native Debug (`webfreak.debug`):
```json
{
    "name": "Ceedling Test Explorer Debug",
    "type": "cppdbg",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/test/out/${command:ceedlingExplorer.debugTestExecutable}",
    "args": [],
    "stopAtEntry": false,
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "environment": [],
    "externalConsole": false,
    "MIMode": "gdb",
    "miDebuggerPath": "C:/MinGW/bin/gdb.exe",
    "setupCommands": [
        {
            "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
            "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
            "ignoreFailures": true
        }
    ]
}
```
